<h5 id='update'>Update!</h5>

<p>Per knotty66&#8217;s suggestion on <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6085695'>Hacker News</a>, I added measurements with NFS on VirtualBox instead of Shared Folders, which speed it up significantly.</p>

<h5 id='update_2'>Update 2!</h5>

<p>joevandyk points out that NFS Shared Folders can help on VMware Fusion too. Added measurements, which shave off a second or two on app boot. Joe also tipped us off to this forum thread detailing other&#8217;s experiences: <a href='http://vagrant.1086180.n5.nabble.com/Shared-folders-slow-using-VMWare-provider-as-well-as-VirtualBox-td935.html'>Shared folders slow using VMWare provider as well as VirtualBox</a></p>

<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<p>Web development on a VM presents plenty of benefits over developing on your host machine: developer environments are easy to distribute, can closely match production, and can be recreated at will. <a href='http://www.vagrantup.com'>Vagrant</a> already handles many headaches around using VMs seamlessly, such as networking and shared filesystems. However, many potential users worry about the performance hit of developing in a VM.</p>

<p>I decided to quantify the difference for typical tasks using my &#8216;native&#8217; OS X machine, Vagrant with the <a href='http://www.virtualbox.com'>VirtualBox</a> provider, and Vagrant with the (paid) <a href='http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware'>Fusion provider</a> atop the (paid) <a href='http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html'>VMware Fusion</a>.</p>

<h3 id='test_setup'>Test Setup</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m using my relatively dinky 2012 MacBook Air - it has a Core i5 chip, an SSD, and 8GB of memory. I was aiming to measure the difference between machines in typical web development tasks, so don&#8217;t take these numbers as absolutes.</p>

<p>I chose to do my measurements on the <a href='https://github.com/discourse/discourse'>Discourse</a> forum application. It&#8217;s written in Ruby on Rails and has a fairly large test suite that&#8217;s comparable in size and complexity to most company&#8217;s applications. Also, it&#8217;s free and open source, so please do try to reproduce these results yourself!</p>

<p>For both VirtualBox and Fusion, I allocated 2GB of RAM to the guest machine. I tried these tests again using only 1GB, but it didn&#8217;t make a significant difference. The guests are running a typical set of services: redis, postgres, nginx.</p>

<p>VirtualBox was also tested with NFS instead of Shared Folders, which has speed benefits outlined here: http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/nfs.html However, you might not be able to use it if your host machine doesn&#8217;t support NFS.</p>

<h4 id='application_boot_time'>Application boot time</h4>

<p>I measured the boot time of the application via the following script:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='nb'>time</span> <span class='sb'>`</span>bundle <span class='nb'>exec </span>script/rails runner <span class='s2'>&quot;0&quot;</span><span class='sb'>`</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Application boot time is one serious source of friction for developers, especially if you&#8217;re doing test-driven development (which you should be!). Note i&#8217;m using Ruby 2.0.0, which improves the performance of the <code>require</code> method significantly over 1.9.3. 10 seconds is a heck of a long time to wait for the app to start - if you&#8217;re interested in improving this check out <a href='https://github.com/martylamb/nailgun'>nailgun</a> (JRuby), <a href='https://github.com/sporkrb/spork'>spork</a> and <a href='https://github.com/burke/zeus'>zeus</a>.</p>

<p>I ran the script three times on each machine and recorded the wall clock time:</p>

<p>I measured the time it took to run the entire Discourse test suite by simply calling:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>The Discourse suite has 2672 individual test cases.</p>

<h3 id='therefore'>Thereforeâ€¦</h3>

<p>VMware Fusion and VirtualBox+NFS are considerably faster than VirtualBox+Shared Folders, and only slightly behind using the host machine.</p>

<p>Using either VM solution in this case also has the nice advantage over the host machine in that you can halt the VM when you&#8217;re not developing to free up all its resources!</p>

<p>Please let us know at <a href='mailto:hello@stackmachine.com'>hello@stackmachine.com</a> about your own experiences with this!</p>

<h3 id='addendum'>Addendum</h3>

<p>I looked a little more into I/O performance for routines like accessing the database that would affect the speed of integration tests. <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/pgbench.html'>pgbench</a> ships with postgres and is a simple albeit synthetic way to measure postgresql performance. In each case the postgres configuration is the default with <code>shared_buffers</code> set to 24MB and autovacuum off. The script I used:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>createdb pgbench
pgbench -i -s 10 pgbench <span class='c'># use scalefactor = 10</span>
pgbench -T 600 pgbench <span class='c'># collect results over 10 minutes</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h5 id='host_machine'>Host Machine:</h5>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>transaction <span class='nb'>type</span>: TPC-B <span class='o'>(</span>sort of<span class='o'>)</span>
scaling factor: 10

</code></pre></div>
<p>So in raw database performance, VMWare is about 20% slower than the host machine, and VirtualBox is 20% slower still - these differences didn&#8217;t correlate to the real-world cases above, though.</p>
