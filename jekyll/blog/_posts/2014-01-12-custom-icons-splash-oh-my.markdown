Many of you have been asking to customize your game, so we're excited to
announce the launch of custom icons and splash screens for all games. Go to the
new "Settings" tab on your game dashboard to choose and upload your icon and
splash screen.

We've also added the ability to choose a version number when releasing a game.
When uploading a new release of your game, you can now pick whatever version
you'd like.
